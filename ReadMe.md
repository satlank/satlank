# Configurations

Collection of all my dotfiles and configurations.  This is collection of my
dotfiles as they have accumulated and evolved over the decades with heavy
inspiration by other kind souls.

## History

### May 2020

First incarnation of this repository, combining several previous locations and
taking lots of inspiration (and settings) from
[wincent](https://github.com/wincent/wincent).

### 2014-2020

Heavy use of [vcsh](https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh) to structure dotfiles and
various attempts at improving vim and bash configurations.
