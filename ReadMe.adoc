= Configurations

This is collection of my dotfiles as they have accumulated and evolved over the
decades with heavy inspiration by other kind souls.

== History

=== May 2020

First incarnation of this repository, combining several previous locations and
taking lots of inspiration (and settings) from
https://github.com/wincent/wincent[wincent].

=== 2014-2020

Heavy use of https://github.com/RichiH/vcsh[vcsh] to structure dotfiles and
various attempts at improving vim and bash configurations.

=== 2003-2014

Some experimentation with tracking configuration in `svn`, but mostly just
living dotfiles that survived the odd hardware changes by being copied over
in time; also manually copying around changes via `scp`.

=== Pre-2003

Let's not go there.
